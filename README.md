This project involves the design and implementation of a web-based, multi-user payment service using the Django framework, mimicking core functionalities of systems like PayPal. The application allows users to register, manage accounts in different currencies, and conduct transactions such as sending and requesting payments. Administrators have access to all user accounts and transaction records. The system emphasizes security through features like user authentication, HTTPS communication, and protection against common web vulnerabilities. Additionally, a RESTful web service for currency conversion is implemented, enhancing the application's functionality. The project demonstrates proficiency in Django's MVC architecture, secure multi-user systems, and RESTful service integration.
